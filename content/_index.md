# About Responsible Artificial Intelligence LLC

Responsible Artificial Intelligence LLC ("Responsible AI LLC" or "RAI LLC") was started by [Jiahao Chen](/about) in September 2022 to provide his consultancy services on artificial intelligence and its uses in regulated industries such as financial services, employment, education, and healthcare.


## What is responsible AI?

Responsible AI is often presented as an umbrella term for AI that incorporates ethics, fairness, explainability, privacy, security, trustworthiness, accountability, and related concerns.
Instead, we adopt a simpler, more general definition:

> Responsible AI systems are built and operated that take into account the needs of multiple stakeholders

Different stakeholders bring different concerns to the table, which naturally encompass the various concerns that are often treated as a simple checklist to be completed before shipment.
However, different people have different needs and desires, which are rarely aligned in practice.
Therefore, we believe that the root problem to solve in responsible AI is not simply to address a checklist of concerns,
but rather to manage multiple objectives which are often in conflict.
A true ethical and responsible AI solution must necesssarily be designed, built and operated with awareness of these conflicting needs,
and include strategies for identifying and managing risks and harms that may emerge over its lifecycle.
Only by doing so will the risks of using responsible AI solutions be properly managed
and its value fully realized by everyone affected.


### Responsible AI in practice

Responsible AI LLC brings you the very latest expertise in compliance and risk management for AI/ML systems, even as regulations continue to evolve month to month. 

*Financial regulatory compliance.*
We bring extensive experience in building and deploying AI/ML systems in major financial institutions.
These environments operate under strict compliance requirements,
ranging from:
- data management requirements under international Basel III standards
  [(BCBS 239)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCBS_239),
- model risk management standards like
  [OCC 11-12 / SR 11-7](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm)
  in the US, and upcoming prudential regulations in the UK outlined in
  [CP 6/22](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2022/june/model-risk-management-principles-for-banks),
- and anti-discrimination and fair lending compliance like
  [Regulation B](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1002/)
  and the
  [Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title15/html/USCODE-2011-title15-chap41-subchapIV.htm)
  in the US.

*Employment regulatory compliance.*
Governments are increasingly passing new laws imposing requirements on AI systems used in employment decisions.
Notably, New York City passed a
[law on automated employment decision tools (AEDT)](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4344524&GUID=B051915D-A9AC-451E-81F8-6596032FA3F9)
which takes effect on January 1, 2023.
[Proposed Rules](https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/rule/automated-employment-decision-tools-2/)
for compliance were only published recently on September 23, 2022,
which notably contain several requirements that are stricter than
the US federal requirements under the
[Equal Employment Opportunity Act (EEOA)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title42/chapter21/subchapter6&edition=prelim)
and the many subsequent federal employmnent laws.

*Regulatory divergence.*
Compliance requirements can vary across national, state and local juridisctions,
and a compliant solution must take into account such regulatory divergence.
Even in something seemingly clear-cut like anti-discrimination laws,
different jurisdictions define different taxonomies of protected classes,
even down to different taxonomies for categories like race,
and have different testing requirements that may or may not account for
intersectionality and data availability.
Responsible AI LLC provides the very latest expertise on delivering compliant solutions taking into account the real-world complexities around data management, model lifecycle, and operational challenges encounteres in the real world, while continuing to deliver business value.
